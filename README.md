# Bob Bot Guide

First of all, if there is question that you have that is not explained here, it is recommended to join [Bob's Discord server](https://discord.gg/33Aw6gWmmV) and ask your question there. You can also keep up to date with Bob's newest updaets and keep track of 
downtime there. 
### Overview

Bob is a multipurpose Discord bot that ccan be used for a variety of things while (hopefully) making the server more cheerful. He is coded in JavaScript with the Discord.js library, but is not open source.
### Can I invite Bob to my server?

For now, the answer is a little bit complicated. Bob is in a quite experimental state at the moment, and he cannot really be relied upon to deliver the most glitch-free experience all the time. *However*, you can join the server linked above and message me (faceboy#1392) directly to ask for Bob to be invited to your server. Note that I will want to be present in your server so that I can more effectively diagnose any errors that could appear.
### What is Bob's prefix?

Bob's default prefix is a dash `-`, but administrators or managers can change that in their server using `-prefix <new prefix>`
### How do arguments work?

An argument is an extra piece of information you provide for a command. *sorry I don't have the time to finish this question or the guide right now I'll finish it later*
